### A study project whose task was to create a program that runs on a machine on a subnet, takes a screenshot of the screen every 10 seconds, and sends it to a senior machine. The senior machine was an Android device running SSH in Termux, and the junior machine was a MacBook. The code is written in pure C++ using basic libraries.
